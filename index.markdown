# Welcome

Welcome to sfpedia. This is the web version of my personal knowledge
system. It is not very fancy but it works well. All my notes are
stored in mark down and I can grep through the directory according to
a keyword. My notes are captured using `denote` in emacs.

I arrived here after trying many different ways to keep track of
things that I was learning or wanted to learn; all my other methods
failed because I'm really lazy and disorganized but this is a system
that works for me.

## Where to begin?

Try the `growth mindset` note. That is probably the most important
one!
