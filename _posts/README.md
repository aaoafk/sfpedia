## Steven Fernandez Personal Knowledge System ##

This is my personal knowledge system. It's done using `denote` and
`grepping` through the entire directory based on a keyword that comes
to mind. 

It's based on some principles that I think have revealed themselves to
me overtime.

1. Notes are ephemeral... They shouldn't be too detailed, if we can
   help it, and they should faciliate exploration of ideas.
   
2. Creating them should be quick and simple because I'm lazy and life
   is hard.
   
Keep this is mind when learning anything:
