*Refactoring* is improving the internal structure of a program without
alternating its functionality, we want to do this because it will make
us better prepared for the demands that the future may bring.

Some of the refactorings may seem useless unless we *imagine them in
the context of a larger system*.

When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not
structured in a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it
easy to add the feature, then add the feature. 

Before we refactor we need a solid set of test suites.
