OmniAuth is a library that standardizes authentication for multiple
providers.

A developer can create **strategies** for OmniAuth that can
authenticate users against any system.

There have been strategies developed for everything from Facebook to
LDAP.

OmniAuth is not coupled to the idea of a user model nor does it make
assumptions about authentication methods we might want to use or what
we're gonna do with the data once a user has been authenticated.

To use OmniAuth we just need to redirect the user to `/auth/:provider`
where `:provider` is the name of the strategy, e.g. `/auth/facebook/`

OmniAuth simply sets a hash called the Authentication Hash on the Rack
environment of a request to `/auth/:provider/callback`. The hash
contains as much information as OmniAuth was able to extract from the
**strategy**.

The `omniauth.auth` key in the environment hash provides an
Authentication Hash which will contain information about the just
authenticated user including a unique id, the strategy they just used
for authentication, and personal details such as name and email
address as available.
