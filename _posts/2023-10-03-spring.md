Spring is a Rails application preloader. It speeds up development by
keeping the application running in the background so we don't need to
boot it every time we run a test, rake task or migration.

We need to add it to our `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "spring", :group => :development
```


It's recommended to *springify* the executables in your `bin/`
directory.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec spring binstub --all
```

This generates a `bin/spring` executable and inserts a small snippet
of code into relevant existing executables. The snippet looks like
this:

```ruby
begin
  load File.expand_path('../spring', __FILE__)
rescue LoadError => e
  raise unless e.message.include?('spring')
end
```

Ensure that `config.enable_reloading = true` in the environments that
Spring manages. That setting is typically configured in
`config/environments/*.rb/`. That config needs to be true for the
`test` environment.

**In versions of Rails before 7.1, the setting is called
`cache_classes` and it needs to be `false` for `Spring` to work.**

Keep in mind that there is an orthogonal tool to this called
`bootsnap`. The difference is that `bootsnap` maintains a cache in
`tmp/cache/*`. This allows `bootsnap` to speed up the loading of
individual source files, `Spring` keeps a copy of a pre-booted Rails
process on hand to completely skip parts of the boot process the next
time it's needed. The two tools work well together.
