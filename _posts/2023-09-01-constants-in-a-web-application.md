In Ruby, constants are variables that are defined with an uppercase letter. Once set, they are expected not to be changed (although Ruby allows you to do so with a warning). Constants are used for storing data that should remain static throughout the execution of the program. They can be defined within classes, modules, or in the main script itself. Constants defined within classes or modules are accessible within those scopes and can also be accessed outside them using the `::` operator.

Here's a simple example:
```ruby
module MyModule
  MY_CONSTANT = 42
end

class MyClass
  MY_CLASS_CONSTANT = 'Hello'
end

puts MyModule::MY_CONSTANT  # Outputs 42
puts MyClass::MY_CLASS_CONSTANT  # Outputs 'Hello'
```

### In the context of a web application:

1. **Framework Boot and Constant Loading**: When a Ruby-based web application starts, the web framework (like Rails) usually boots and initializes the environment. During this boot process, constants defined in your application are loaded into memory.

2. **Constant Autoloading**: In a development environment, frameworks like Rails can automatically load constants as they are referenced. This is known as "autoloading." This is convenient for development but is typically disabled in a production environment for performance reasons.

3. **Thread Safety**: Ruby web applications often use a multi-threaded environment to handle multiple requests concurrently. Constants, being part of the loaded Ruby environment, are accessible across all threads. This is safe because constants are not supposed to change.

4. **Namespacing**: Constants defined in different parts of an application (different classes, modules) will not clash because they are scoped to those classes or modules.

5. **Persistence Across Requests**: Because web applications in Ruby are typically run as long-running processes, the constants remain in memory between requests. This is different from languages like PHP, where typically everything is torn down and rebuilt between requests.

6. **Reloading**: In a development environment, it's common to be able to reload code to see changes without restarting the entire application. Some frameworks support this by "unloading" the old version of the code and loading the new version. Constants get replaced in this process.

7. **Memory**: Once loaded, constants do take up memory. However, they are generally not a significant concern regarding memory usage unless you are storing large data sets in them.

Understanding how constants work can help you manage configuration, shared values, and other static data effectively in your web applications.
