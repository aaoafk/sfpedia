A proxy is a computer that routes a request for you and returns the
response from the target. It is just a computer that sits between you
and the internet.

**Proxies issue different IP addresses to us after connecting to the
proxy server.**

They let us fake our identities to a certain extent.

Unlike _VPN_ which is its own application and affects all your
connections, we sometimes have to configure proxy servers with each
application seperately.

We also need to buy access to proxy servers and there are different
kinds, one e.g. is a _rotating proxy_ server, there are different
pricing models.

When we get proxies its important to test them. What does testing look
like?

1. Verify the proxy server works.
2. Verify the IPs can access the websites we need.
3. If the proxies make us anonymous.
4. If they belong to the country we intended and used the right IP
   type.
