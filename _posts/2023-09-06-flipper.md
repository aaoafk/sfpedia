Features are the heart of flipper they allow us to enable/disable code based on different types of enablements.

Booleans switch all on or off. Easy way to release a new feature, as once a feature is boolean enabled it is on for every situation.


BOOLEAN EXAMPLE: 

```ruby

user = User.find(...)

Flipper.enabled? :search # => false
Flipper.enabled? :search, user # => false

Flipper.enable? :search

Flipper.enabled? :search # => true
```

GROUP EXAMPLE:

```ruby
user = User.find(...) # => user who returns false for `.admin?`
admin = User.find(...) # => user who returns true for `.admin?` method

# The block is the definition for whether the actor will have it enabled
Flipper.register(:admins) do |actor, ctx|
  actor.respond_to?(:admin?) && actor.admin?
end

# Enable the block `:admins`, future checks to `enabled?` will see if actor to block returns true
Flipper.enable_group(:documentation, :admins)

Flipper.enabled? :documentation, user # => false
Flipper.enabled? :documentation, admin # => true
```

The element yielded to the block can be anything. We need to make sure that the logic we implement makes sense for our case. It's a good idea to validate whatever is passed into that `.register` proc.

ACTOR example:

Turn a feature on for one thing: Think enable feature for someone to test


```ruby
user = User.find(...)

other_user = User.find(...)

Flipper.enabled? :verbose_logging # => false
Flipper.enabled? :verbose_logging, user) # => false

Flipper.enable_actor :verbose_logging, user

Flipper.enabled? :verbose_logging, other_user # => false
Flipper.enabled? :verbose_logging, user # => true
```

NOTE: Actors must have a unique `flipper_id`. We can include the `Flipper::Identifier` module for a default implementation that adds `flipper_id` which combines the class name and `id`!

DONT `enable_actor` for a large number of users. Instad use a `group` or `% of actors.

PERCENTAGE OF ACTORS EXAMPLE:

Slow rollout of a new feature to a percentage of things:

```ruby

user = User.find(...) # responds to `flipper_id` message...

Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors :otp, 25

# returns true or false consistently for the same enabled percentage and actor

Flipper.enabled? :otp, user
```

It seems like the percentage of actors is determined by whether or not a model responds to `flipper_id`

Once you're ready to enable the feature do it through the console:

```ruby
$ rails console
>> Flipper.enable :feature_name
```

```ruby
$ rails console
>> Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors :otp, 25
```
