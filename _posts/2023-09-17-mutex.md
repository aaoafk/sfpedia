Mutex implements a simple semaphore that can be used to coordinate
access to shared data from threads that are running concurrently.

In the figure above we have 3 threads that are executing and need to
share a resource.

If we don't implement concurrency correctly then our *shared data* is
gonna be off. This is captured in the idea of a *race condition*.

**Semaphores** are a kind of lock that use an integer flag to indicate
whether the resource can be accessed. When a thread acquires the lock
the flag is decremented. When a thread releases the lock the flag is
incremented. When a thread tries to acquire the lock it will check if
the flag is set to 1 which means the lock is free to acquire.
Otherwise, it will wait.
