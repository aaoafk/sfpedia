MLS only lists data available from other brokerages. To list on MLS
you need to be a licensed agent or broker in that state.

Property Managers don't have a license so they can't list on MLS.

Property Managers need to work with a brokerage to increase their
changes of renting.

RentalBeast & YGL. Are listing agencies.

Brokerages reach out to property managers to get their property
listed.

Nobee needs data from other listing services because they work with
specific landlords who have their property listed only on their
website.

Application Process

**Agencies have relationships with landlords.**

**Relationships with landlords lead to differences in sets of property
data.**

**Differences in sets of property data need to be enumerated.**

**If you don't have the data then:**

1. We need the data. We can scrape websites to get this data.
2. We need to consolidate the data. What does that mean?
3. Once the data is consolidated it is transformed into a format that
   nobee can ingest and display on their website.
   
**crawler strategy in a way to avoid being rate limited by the site.**

*******

**The data is not useful without the landlord**
