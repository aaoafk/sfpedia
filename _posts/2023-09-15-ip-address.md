Each internet-connected device has an IP address. It’s a sequence of
numbers that identifies the device on a network. Without it, computers
wouldn’t be able to communicate with one another – just like a postman
couldn’t deliver mail to you without knowing your home address. An IP
address holds some additional information about you, such as which
company sells you internet access or where approximately your device
is located.
