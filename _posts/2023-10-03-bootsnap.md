`bootsnap` is a tool to speed up the loading of source files. It
relies on placing cached files in `tmp/cache/bootsnap*`.

We can add it to our gem file:

```ruby
gem "bootsnap"
```

Then we need to add it to `boot.rb` **as early as possible** to get
the biggest speed up. The documentation recommends doing this right
after `require "bundler/setup"`.

Example:

```ruby
ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] ||= File.expand_path('../Gemfile', __dir__)

require 'bundler/setup' # Set up gems listed in the Gemfile.
require 'bootsnap/setup' # => Faster boot
```
