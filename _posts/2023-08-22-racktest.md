Rack::Test is a small, simple testing API for Rack apps. It can be
used on its own or as a reusable starting point for Web frameworks and
testing libraries to build on.

Roughly we ~include Rack::Test::Methods~, all we need to fake HTTP
requests and what not and we implement a method that returns an object
which represents our web application...

```ruby
    def app
        lambda { |env| [200, {'content-type' => 'text/plain'}, ['All responses are OK']] }
  end
```

_rack-test_ will test the app that is returned by the ~app~ method. If
we're loading middleware config in a ~config.ru~ file, and want to
test that, we should load the Rack app created from the ~config.ru~
file.
