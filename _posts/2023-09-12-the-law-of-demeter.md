The law of Demeter places emphasis on loosely coupled objects.

Demeter restricts message chaining especially when we are chaining
objects that are of different types.

Demeter is often paraphrased as "only talk to your immediate
neighbors" or "use only one dot"

It should exist as just a guideline for writing code that is
understandable not as an absolute rule.

Long message chains also bring to mind the importance in the what vs
how distinction.
