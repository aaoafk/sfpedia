declare a dependency on a gem with ~gem GEM_NAME_AS_STRING~.

Most of the version specifiers, like >= 1.0, are self-explanatory. The
specifier ~> has a special meaning, best shown by example. ~> 2.0.3 is
identical to >= 2.0.3 and < 2.1. ~> 2.1 is identical to >= 2.1 and <
3.0. ~> 2.2.beta will match prerelease versions like 2.2.beta.12. ~> 0
is identical to >= 0.0 and < 1.0.

Keep in mind that gems specified in an engines gemspec file already do
need to be explicitly required, by default.

On the other hand, we can skip automatically `require`ing a feature
from a gemfile by passing `require: false` to `gem`.

Example:

```ruby
gem "foo", require: false # => gem is installed but not required

# in the file that we expect to use the code 

class Foo
  require "foo"
  ...
end
```
