A _load balancer_ is a computer that distributes requests across
computers. 

A _load balancer_ is often confused with a _reverse proxy_ but they
are different.

A _load balancer_ is usually deployed only when you need to scale up,
i.e. you're receiving so many requests that your server is literally
erroring out because of the load.

A _load balancer_ often checks if your application servers are up, via
something like a _health check_, and distributes requests based on
computers that it knows are good to go.

Keep in mind that some _load balancers_ are aware of **session
persistence**. Although HTTP is a stateless protocol, web applications
sometimes need to keep track of a users session in order to do stuff,
but if a _load balancer_ routes a request its seen before to a
different computer than computer that has the session state we'll have
issues. 

While a _reverse proxy_ is more like the "public face" of your
website. 

Its address is the one advertised for the website, and it sits at the
edge of the siteâ€™s network to accept requests from web browsers and
mobile apps for the content hosted at the website.
